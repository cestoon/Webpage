					<p>&emsp;&emsp;The modern figure painter is a modern excellent figure painter and art educator. Based on the traditional Chinese paintings, he integrated the lengths of western paintings and creatively expanded the techniques of Chinese ink paintings. His meticulous shape and his profound inner world represent a new height in the history of Chinese figure painting. Former National Central University of Nanjing (National Central University changed its name to Nanjing University in 1949), Professor of the Central Academy of Fine Arts.</p>
					<p>&emsp;&emsp;Jiang Zhaohe (1904-1986) is known as the great master of modern Chinese ink paintings of the 20th century, and the great master of Chinese modern art.

					<p>&emsp;&emsp;Jiang Zhaohe possesses the most valuable qualities shared by great artists - sincerely. His hard life has left him alone in the suffering of the society, and his burning and upright conscience has left him alone in his labor. “In Yu’s desert, take a look at the camel that slowly ran away.” “When the flames are in the heat, listen to the unbearable bitterness.” It is life that touches his soul. "So I know that some people need a bowl of bitter tea to quench their thirst." "... If it's true, I would like to cook a bowl of bitter tea wholeheartedly. I would like to dedicate myself to the public before giving it to the public." Under his pen The portrayed figures, the poor and miserable refugees, all have a simple, kind, and unyielding personality. Innocent children and innocent girls are always bitter in beauty. On the picture frame devoted to love and blood, you may not see the beautiful and graceful "ink-and-dark, five-color" glory of "a wave of twists and turns", but the meticulous viewers can allay from the frequently-sudden sketches and the vigorous and awkward rubs. , with the heart to see the sad and painful rhythm of that era. One of my friends used to compare the "dark and stout lines" in Jiang Zhaohe's paintings to the "scars". Jiang Zhaohe has sincerely played his artistic personality. If the beauty created by the realist landscape artist Li Keran is solemn and profound, then the realist figure painter Jiang Zhaohe's created beauty is noble and bitter. If Miller, the realist painter of the French century, expresses the holiness and simplicity of the laborer through peaceful and warm daily life, then Jiang Zhaohe's miserable life in the 20th century demonstrated the tragic and desolateness of the working people.</p>
